# ResQ-Chain

**Hyper-local food waste rescue platform — AI-driven dynamic markdown and real-time redistribution.**

ResQ-Chain integrates with grocery inventories to continuously evaluate batch expiration timelines
against real-time variables (weather, historical demand, foot traffic). Instead of static, calendar-based
discounts, a machine learning engine computes the optimal markdown to liquidate stock efficiently. When
a batch crosses a critical expiry threshold, the platform automatically triggers targeted B2B/B2C flash
sales via SMS and WhatsApp to nearby buyers and shelters — turning potential retail loss into community
resources before spoilage occurs.

> For the full problem/market/ML/roadmap writeup this repo is built from, see the project playbook

## Core Features

| # | Feature | Summary |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Predictive AI Markdown Engine | Scikit-Learn model factors weather, inventory volume, and time-to-expiry to set optimal discount depth. |
| 2 | Hyper-Local Geo-Fenced Targeting | PostgreSQL + PostGIS radius queries so alerts only reach realistically reachable users. |
| 3 | Frictionless Click-to-Claim | Tokenized, single-use claim link — no account, no app install. |
| 4 | Secure Checkout &amp; Fulfillment Choice | Reserve-then-pay flow (Stripe/Razorpay), pickup or delivery. |
| 5 | High-Concurrency Reservation Locking | Redis TTL locks prevent double-claiming on simultaneous alerts. |
| 6 | Eco-Impact Analytics Dashboard | Real-time dollars saved, lbs rescued, CO&#8322;e avoided. |
| 7 | Reliability Scoring | Claim-to-pickup ratio routes urgent alerts to dependable users first. |
| 8 | Rescue Squads (Standing Orders) | Shelters/NGOs subscribe to rule-based priority routing instead of one-off blasts. |
| 9 | Dynamic Descending-Price Auctions | Live WebSocket-driven price ticks for high-volume batches. |
| 10 | Shareable Impact Receipts | Auto-generated "you just rescued X lbs / saved Y kg CO2" social shareable. |
| 11 | WhatsApp + SMS Reply-to-Claim | Twilio-powered, works on low-connectivity/feature phones. |
| 12 | Zero-Effort Store Onboarding | OCR/barcode scan pre-fills batch expiry and product data. |
| 13 | Accessibility-First Claim Page | Low-bandwidth, large tap targets, multi-language toggle. |
| 14 | Predictive Pre-Alerts | "Likely to discount around 6 PM" heads-up notifications. |

## Tech Stack

- **Backend &amp; AI:** Python (FastAPI), Scikit-Learn, Joblib
- **Data &amp; Infra:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Redis, Celery
- **Frontend &amp; Mapping:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js (Mapbox GL JS as upgrade path)
- **Communications:** Twilio API (SMS + WhatsApp Business API, inbound webhooks)
- **Payments:** Stripe / Razorpay (checkout + webhooks)

Full rationale for each choice lives in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <repo-url> resq-chain && cd resq-chain
cp infra/.env.example infra/.env   # fill in Twilio / Stripe-Razorpay / weather API keys

# 2. Boot the stack
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up --build

# 3. Seed demo data (stores, batches, users) for a working demo out of the box
docker compose exec backend python -m app.scripts.seed_demo_data

# 4. Open
# Claim page (public):     http://localhost:3000
# Store dashboard:         http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# API docs (FastAPI):      http://localhost:8000/docs
```
